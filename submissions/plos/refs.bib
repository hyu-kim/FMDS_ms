   abstract = {Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is an essential technique in multivariate analysis, with Weighted MDS (WMDS) commonly employed for tasks such as dimensionality reduction and graph drawing. However, the optimization of WMDS poses significant challenges due to the highly non-convex nature of its objective function. Stress Majorization, a method classified under the Majorization-Minimization algorithm, is among the most widely used solvers for this problem because it guarantees non-increasing loss values during optimization, even with a non-convex objective function. Despite this advantage, Stress Majorization suffers from high computational complexity, specifically $\mathcal{O}(\max(n^3, n^2 p))$ per iteration, where $n$ denotes the number of data points, and $p$ represents the projection dimension, rendering it impractical for large-scale data analysis. To mitigate the computational challenge, we introduce StableMDS, a novel gradient descent-based method that reduces the computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2 p)$ per iteration. StableMDS achieves this computational efficiency by applying gradient descent independently to each point, thereby eliminating the need for costly matrix operations inherent in Stress Majorization. Furthermore, we theoretically ensure non-increasing loss values and optimization stability akin to Stress Majorization. These advancements not only enhance computational efficiency but also maintain stability, thereby broadening the applicability of WMDS to larger datasets.},

Here we present den-SNE and densMAP, which are density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and demonstrate their ability to accurately incorporate information about transcriptomic variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Applied to recently published datasets, our methods reveal significant changes in transcriptomic variability in a range of biological processes, including heterogeneity in transcriptomic variability of immune cells in blood and tumor, human immune cell specialization and the developmental trajectory of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in other scientific domains.},

The SOM forms a non-linear mapping of the data to a two-dimensional map grid that can be used as an exploratory data analysis tool for generating hypotheses on the relationships, and ultimately of the function of the genes. Similarity relationships within the data and cluster structures can be visualized and interpreted. The methods are demonstrated by computing a SOM of yeast genes. The relationships of known functional classes of genes are investigated by analyzing their distribution on the SOM, the cluster structure is visualized by the U-matrix method, and the clusters are characterized in terms of the properties of the expression profiles of the genes. Finally, it is shown that the SOM visualizes the similarity of genes in a more trustworthy way than two alternative methods, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering.},

A local measure of trustworthiness is proposed and it is shown for three data sets that neighborhood relationships visualized by the Self-Organizing Map and its variant, the Generative Topographic Mapping, are more trustworthy than visualizations produced by traditional multidimensional scaling-based nonlinear projection methods.},

Ratios between components of a composition are important since they are unaffected by the particular set of components chosen. Logarithms of ratios (logratios) are the fundamental transformation in the ratio approach to compositional data analysis—all data thus need to be strictly positive, so that zero values present a major problem. Components that group together based on domain knowledge can be amalgamated (i.e., summed) to create new components, and this can alleviate the problem of data zeros. Once compositional data are transformed to logratios, regular univariate and multivariate statistical analysis can be performed, such as dimension reduction and clustering, as well as modeling. Alternative methodologies that come close to the ideals of the logratio approach are also considered, especially those that avoid the problem of data zeros, which is particularly acute in large bioinformatic data sets.},

   abstract = {Author Summary The term microbiome refers to the ecosystem of microbes that live in a defined environment. The decreasing cost and increasing speed of DNA sequencing technology has recently provided scientists with affordable and timely access to the genes and genomes of microbiomes that inhabit our planet and even our own bodies. In these investigations many microbiome samples are sequenced at the same time on the same DNA sequencing machine, but often result in total numbers of sequences per sample that are vastly different. The common procedure for addressing this difference in sequencing effort across samples – different library sizes – is to either (1) base analyses on the proportional abundance of each species in a library, or (2) rarefy, throw away sequences from the larger libraries so that all have the same, smallest size. We show that both of these normalization methods can work when comparing obviously-different whole microbiomes, but that neither method works well when comparing the relative proportions of each bacterial species across microbiome samples. We show that alternative methods based on a statistical mixture model perform much better and can be easily adapted from a separate biological sub-discipline, called RNA-Seq analysis.},

In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable.

We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.},

   abstract = {In recent years, many dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms have been proposed for visual analysis of multidimensional data. Given a set of n-dimensional observations, such algorithms create a 2D or 3D projection thereof that preserves relative distances or neighborhoods. The quality of resulting projections is strongly influenced by many choices, such as the DR techniques used and their various parameter settings. Users find it challenging to judge the effectiveness of a projection in maintaining features from the original space and to understand the effect of parameter settings on these results, as well as performing related tasks such as comparing two projections. We present a set of interactive visualizations that aim to help users with these tasks by revealing the quality of a projection and thus allowing inspection of parameter choices for DR algorithms, by observing the effects of these choices on the resulting projection. Our visualizations target questions regarding neighborhoods, such as finding false and missing neighbors and showing how such projection errors depend on algorithm or parameter choices. By using several space-filling techniques, our visualizations scale to large datasets. We apply our visualizations on several recent DR techniques and high-dimensional datasets, showing how they easily offer local detail on point and group neighborhood preservation while relieving users from having to understand technical details of projections.},

   abstract = {Author summary scRNA-seq brings both great opportunities and challenges for transcriptomic analysis. While scRNA-seq enables the characterization of cell heterogeneity at an unprecedented resolution, analytical issues like sparsity, noise and bias can severely compromise interpretation if not addressed properly. To extract meaningful biological signals, effective feature selection is critical. We propose Mcadet, a novel framework for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Mcadet aims to accurately identify informative genes from fine-resolution datasets and datasets with minority cell types where existing methods falter. Through comparative analysis on diverse simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrate Mcadet’s superior performance in selecting highly informative genes based on many evaluation metrics in different scenarios, by effectively isolating intrinsic variation and allowing multi-resolution community detection. By improving the process of feature selection of scRNA-seq data, Mcadet makes it easier for researchers from various backgrounds to work with scRNA-seq data. This means that people can benefit from more reliable and accessible insights into single-cell transcriptomics.},

More appropriate metrics quantifying neighborhood and class preservation reveal the elephant in the room: while t-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell data do not preserve high-dimensional distances, they can nevertheless provide biologically relevant information.},

   abstract = {Explorative visualization techniques provide a first summary of microbiome read count datasets through dimension reduction. A plethora of dimension reduction methods exists, but many of them focus primarily on sample ordination, failing to elucidate the role of the bacterial species. Moreover, implicit but often unrealistic assumptions underlying these methods fail to account for overdispersion and differences in sequencing depth, which are two typical characteristics of sequencing data. We combine log-linear models with a dispersion estimation algorithm and flexible response function modelling into a framework for unconstrained and constrained ordination. The method is able to cope with differences in dispersion between taxa and varying sequencing depths, to yield meaningful biological patterns. Moreover, it can correct for observed technical confounders, whereas other methods are adversely affected by these artefacts. Unlike distance-based ordination methods, the assumptions underlying our method are stated explicitly and can be verified using simple diagnostics. The combination of unconstrained and constrained ordination in the same framework is unique in the field and facilitates microbiome data exploration. We illustrate the advantages of our method on simulated and real datasets, while pointing out flaws in existing methods. The algorithms for fitting and plotting are available in the R-package RCM.},

   abstract = {Author summary With today’s unprecedented amount of data, researchers are challenged by the need to enhance meaningful signals without the interference of unwanted confounders hidden inside the data. Data visualization is an important step toward exploring and explaining data in order to intuitively identify the dominant patterns. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), as a visualization tool, allows flexible ways to define pairwise distances and project the samples into lower dimensions without changing the distances. However, when visualizing large-scale biological datasets, the true patterns are often hindered by unwanted confounding variations, either biologically or technically in origin. To eliminate these confounding factors and recover underlying signals, we proposed a method called Adjustment for Confounding factors using Principal Coordinate Analysis, or AC-PCoA, and showed that it significantly outperforms existing methods in visualization through three simulation studies and five real datasets. We further showed that the low-dimensional representations given by AC-PCoA provide promising results in statistical testing, clustering, and classification as well.},

Microbial sequences have enhanced our understanding of the human microbiome, the soil and plant environment, and the marine environment. All molecular microbial data pose statistical challenges due to contamination sequences from reagents, batch effects, unequal sampling, and undetected taxa. Technical biases and heteroscedasticity have the strongest effects, but different strains across subjects and environments also make direct differential abundance testing unwieldy. We provide an introduction to a few statistical tools that can overcome some of these difficulties and demonstrate those tools on an example. We show how standard statistical methods, such as simple hierarchical mixture and topic models, can facilitate inferences on latent microbial communities. We also review some nonparametric Bayesian approaches that combine visualization and uncertainty quantification. The intersection of molecular microbial biology and statistics is an exciting new venue. Finally, we list some of the important open problems that would benefit from more careful statistical method development.},

To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.},

   abstract = {UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},
